### Hi everybody! ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Currently working for multinational CRODA / Incotec as a consultant for Wayon_IT. 
        I am located in Brazil, however I perform activities for offices in 
        London and Shanghai doing data insertion and problem analysis.

- ðŸŒ± I am studying faculty of analysis and systems development and other courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScrip and 
        until the end of 2020 I will take courses in MySQL and Phyton.

- ðŸ‘¯ I try to collaborate on projects that help me develop my skills. 
        I would love to learn more about mobile and machine / deep learing development 
        (In fact, in the future I hope to collaborate more in these areas above).

- ðŸ¤” If someone can help me at the beginning of my learning, I will be very grateful. 
      I'm trying to be a good programmer and hoping to be able to start correctly.

- ðŸ’¬ If you need help with app and system design, you can count on me. 
      I have great creativity and the ability to think about the applicability of a technology.

- ðŸ˜„ A curiosity: I also work with theater and cinema. For more than 19 years I worked as a professional actor, 
      executive director of cultural projects and professor of interpretation for theater, TV and cinema ... 
      I greatly improved my creativity and communication skills, but I always had a thing for technology. âš¡ 
      
See you in the next code!
